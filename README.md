# Online-Ticket-Management-System
This is a web-based Bus Ticket Booking System developed using JSP, Servlets, and Java, with JDBC for database connectivity. The system allows users to register, log in, view bus details, and book tickets. The backend logic is managed using Servlets, and the database interactions are handled through a dedicated JDBC connection class.
